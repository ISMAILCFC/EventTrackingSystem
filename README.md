# EventTrackingSystem
 
This project is my first project on java. We made this program so that students at the university can easily follow the activities. 
You can join the system and follow the activities.
If you are in the position of manager or event owner, you can add an event to the system and follow the attendance.
Also, this project can be easily converted to an application for phones.
